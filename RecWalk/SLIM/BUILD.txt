------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building requires 

 - CMake 2.8, found at http://www.cmake.org/, as well as GNU make. 
 - A export of the latest trunk of GKlib (see bellow).  

Assumming that the above are available, two commands should suffice to 
build the software:

     $ make config
     $ make


GKlib
-----
Prior to running "make config" create a symbolic link to GKlib's trunk directory
inside the top-level directory of rsuggest. For instance, the following command
should do it:

     $ ln -s ~/local/src/GKlib/trunk GKlib

which assumes that you have checked out the latest version of GKlib in your
~/local/src directory.


Configuration
-------------
SLIM is primarily configured by passing options to make config. For example:

     $ make config shared=1 cc=gcc-4.2

would configure rsuggest to be built as a shared library using GCC 4.2.

Common configuration options are:
  cc=[compiler]   - The C compiler to use [default is determined by CMake]
  shared=1        - Build a shared library instead of a static one 
                    [off by default]
  prefix=[PATH]   - Set the installation prefix [/usr/local/ by default]

Advanced debugging related options:
  gdb=1       - Build with support for GDB [off by default]
  debug=1     - Enable debugging support [off by default]
  assert=1    - Enable asserts [off by default]
  assert2=1   - Enable very expensive asserts [off by default]


Installation
------------
To install, run

    $ make install

The default installation prefix is /usr/local. To pick an installation 
prefix pass prefix=[path] to make config. For example,

    $ make config prefix=~/myroot/

will cause the program to be installed in ~/myroot/ when make install 
is run.


Other make commands
-------------------
   $ make uninstall 
          Removes all files installed by 'make install'.
   
   $ make clean 
          Removes all object files but retains the configuration options.
   
   $ make distclean 
          Performs clean and completely removes the build directory.
